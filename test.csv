"This paper presents the results of a population-based epidemiologic case-control study conducted in 22 counties of central California to investigate the possible association between perineal talc use and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk. Telephone interviews were conducted with 256 cases diagnosed in the years 2000-2001 and 1,122 controls frequency-matched on age and ethnicity. The study found that the odds ratio (OR) for ever use of talc was 1.37 compared to never users, but no dose-response association was found. Tubal ligation modified the effect of talc on EOC, and talc use and EOC risk was highest in women with serous invasive tumors. The study provides some support for the hypothesis that perineal talc use is associated with an increased risk of EOC.","Paul K. Mills, Deborah G. Riordan, Rosemary D. Cress, and Heather A.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of a population-based epidemiologic case-control study conducted in 22 counties of central California to investigate the possible association between perineal talc use and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk.

The study found that the odds ratio (OR) for ever use of talc was 1.37 compared to never users, but no dose-response association was found. Tubal ligation modified the effect of talc on EOC, and talc use and EOC risk was highest in women with serous invasive tumors. The study provides some support for the hypothesis that perineal talc use is associated with an increased risk of EOC.","Experiment Methodology: The study used regional cancer registries and RDD methods to identify cases and controls.

Conclusion: The study found an association between perineal talc use and epithelial ovarian cancer.

Study Size: The study included 635 cases and 1,122 controls.

Study Duration: The study covered the period between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2001.

Strength of data: The study had a response fraction of 40% among all cases identified and 57% for total identified eligible controls. The study also matched cases and controls for age and ethnicity.","The study included 635 cases and 1,122 controls.","The study had a response fraction of 40% among all cases identified and 57% for total identified eligible controls.

"This paper investigates the possible association between ovarian carcinoma and talcum powder use. Epidemiologic investigations have varied in their results, but histologic sections of ovarian carcinomas have shown the presence of talc particles. The study interviewed 450 patients with borderline and invasive ovarian carcinoma and 564 population controls in metropolitan Toronto and nearby areas of southern Ontario, Canada, about their reproductive and menstrual histories as well as their exposure to dusting powders. The results showed a significant association between exposure to talc, via sanitary napkins, direct application to the perineum, or both, and risk of ovarian carcinoma. The study supports previous contentions that exposure to talc may increase the risk of ovarian carcinoma, and further studies may be needed to clarify the role of talc in the etiology of this disease.","Stella Chang, B.A. and Talcharn Harvey, M.D., Ph.D.","The study found that regular talc use was associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer.","The study was conducted between November 1, 1989, and October 31, 1992.","The study is an observational case-control study.","Paper name: Perineal Talc Exposure and Risk of Ovarian Carcinoma
